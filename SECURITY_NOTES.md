# Password Security Awareness Notes

## Why It Matters
Weak passwords are the #1 entry point for hackers. According to Verizon's 2024 Data Breach Report:
- 81% of breaches involve weak or stolen credentials.

**Key Stats (2025)**:
- Average password length: 8 chars (too short!)
- 23% of users reuse passwords.
- 2FA blocks 99.9% of automated attacks.

## Best Practices
1. **Length & Complexity**: 12+ chars, mix all types.
2. **Uniqueness**: One per account.
3. **2FA**: Always enable.
4. **Updates**: Change every 3–6 months.
5. **Phishing Defense**: Never click suspicious links.
